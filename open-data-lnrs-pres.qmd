## LNRS: Overview {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}

- ‘New, England-wide system of spatial strategies that will establish priorities - map proposals for specific actions to drive nature’s recovery and provide - environmental benefits’
- ~50 strategies across England that will map delivery of the national Nature Recovery Network

## LNRS: Overview {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}
- Each LNRS:
    - Will direct net gain funding and have a broader role in the planning system
    - May be used to prioritise activities within parts of the new ELM Scheme
    - Will inform the targeting of nature-based solutions
    - Will support cross-sectoral alignment of environmental policy and funds
    - Public Authorities must *have regard* to any relevant local nature recovery     strategy

## Why Open Data? {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}

- Helps us share data resources with our residents and partners
- Delivers our commitments to transparency and digital plan
- A foundation for building apps to add value to data products

## Source Data {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}

- Spreadsheet
- Areas, priorities, measures, grants
- Grant data online ~300 grants
- Data cleaning 
- Build data model
- ~700 lines of R code

## Building the app {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}

- Map - driven
  - QGIS processing of area polygon vertices
- Relational vs. flat model for main table
- Refactoring R code to construct flat table ~11K records
- Load data onto ODP
- Write code to create the app
  - HTML - building blocks for the web
  - Angular JS - control the logic of the clickable elements
  - ODS widgets - modular components to access data (maps, queries)
  - CSS - make it look nice


## Challenges {background-image="plots/weca_ppt_image_sized_3.png"}

- Understanding the data model and responding to client requirements
- New widgets which implement SQL
- CSS - obscure and unintuitive
- Refactoring code and data model post consultation
- Developing solution for changing source data
